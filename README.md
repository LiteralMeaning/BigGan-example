Deep Generative Models
With the rise of deep learning, a new family of methods, called deep generative models (DGMs),[8][9] is formed through the combination of generative models and deep neural networks. The trick of DGMs is that the neural networks used as generative models have a number of parameters significantly smaller than the amount of data used to train them on, so the models are forced to discover and efficiently internalize the essence of the data in order to generate it.

Popular DGMs include Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and auto-regressive models. There is a trend to build large deep generative models.[8] For example, GPT-3, and its precursor GPT-2,[10] for auto-regressive neural language models, BigGAN[11] and VQ-VAE[12] for image generation, Optimus[13] as the largest VAE language model, and jukebox as the largest VAE model for music generation.[14]

DGMs have many short-term applications. But in the long run, they hold the potential to automatically learn the natural features of a dataset, whether categories or dimensions or something else entirely.[9]
